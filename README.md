# A Text editor based on CodeMirror

## Author: Maksim Lin

## Introduction

cmte is a browser-based text editor that uses the excellant CodeMirror
text editor component.

The name cmte is a homage to my long cross-platform text editor SciTE,
which was named after its key text editor component Scintilla.
